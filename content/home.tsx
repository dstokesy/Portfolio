      '<p>Frontend development is my main area of expertise, having worked in both agency and corporate settings. I currently work for Flutter Entertainment using React and React Native to develop frontend solutions to business requirements utilising practices such as TDD. Projects I have worked on whilst there have been the <a href="/projects/skybet">Sky Bet</a> and <a href="/projects/betfair">Bet Fair</a> website and apps, this involves maintaining the existing technology stack and helping to build the new Sky Bet website and apps which is based on the Bet Fair stack.</p><p>My previous job was working for Rejuvenate Digital, during this time I implemented changes such as from moving from Gulp to WebPack, Less to Scss and implementing Babel into our development processes to allow our team to move away from writing jQuery and write ES6 JavaScript.<p>A project I completed at Rejuvenate was the third party integration with Algolia Search on <a href="/projects/sanctuary">Sanctuary Bathrooms</a>, this was used to build a predictive keyword search, filters including disjunctive facets and recommended products. I have also used the Google Maps API on <a href="/projects/rightfuelcard">Right Fuel Card</a> to build their site locator page which takes advantage of the more advanced features of the API to build route finder functionality.</p>',

      '<p>Although starting out as a frontend developer I took it upon myself to learn backend development to become a more rounded developer. This has given me many advantages, most recently I was selected to move to a more advanced team in my current job at Flutter which has allowed me to hone my skills further. It also enabled me to be a very valuable member of the team at Rejuvenate Digital as I could ensure projects were built in the most efficient way when it came to the front and backend of a project interacting with each other.</p><p>Whilst at Flutter I have worked on PHP and Node JS projects working with API&apos;s to enable customers to cashout, track and obtain in-play data on bets. Working at Flutter also led me to working on technologies such as Chef and Kubernates whilst also providing me the experience I lacked in working with high traffic and high availability applications.</p><p>Whilst at Rejuvenate Digital I was heavily involved in moving the team from a basic in house PHP framework to a Laravel Based framework called October CMS. This involved the building of several bespoke plugins so the company didn&apos;t over rely on third party plugins for their projects. Just a few of the plugins I was in charge of development for were the Shop plugin which provided full e-commerce functionality, a <a href="/projects/form">form builder plugin</a> I built as a project in my personal time and a <a href="/projects/form">franchising plugin</a>.</p>',

      "<p>To become a well rounded developer I have always made an effort to improve my soft skill. I currently work using agile metholodiges which means I am more than comfortable working closely with a team communcating well and making sure everyone is kept up to date.</p><p>Having worked as a senior developer means I&apos;m in charge of training new staff members. To do this well I had to work on my communication skills so I could explain different processes and justify their purpose. Good communication skills are also important when evaluating other developers&apos; performances so my feedback can help improve developers in their skills and confidence.</p><p>As my development experience has been in the fast paced world of agency work, time management and organisation skills have been an important tool to make sure tasks and projects are completed on time and to a high standard. By keeping on top of my work and being proactive I feel this has helped make me become a better and more efficient developer.</p>",
